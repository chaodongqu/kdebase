# with *_ICON = AUTO automake copies them automaticly into the right folders.
# the naming-convention which is nessesary for this is:
# <theme><size>-<type>-<name>.png (they will be installed as <name>.png)
#
# <theme> is "hi", "lo" or "cr" for hicolor, locolor or crystal
# <size> is 16, 22 or 32 for locolor; 16, 22, 32, 48, 64, 128 or "sc" for hicolor and Crystal.
#	"sc" stands for scalable and should be in SVG format compressed with GZip and with the
#	extention .svgz.
# <type> is "app" for an application icon,
#	"mime" for a mimetype icon,
#	"action" for a menu-item/toolbar-button,
#	"filesys" for some filesystem icons (dirs etc.) and
#	"device" for the cdrom/floppy/harddisk/etc. icons.
