  <title>Note from the Editors</title>

  <para>As you may notice, this handbook is written by various authors.
        The draft explanation of new features is done by the developers on the 
        krusader-devel mailinglist, the editors add this information in this handbook.
        We have taken much care in ensuring technical and vocabulary consistency.
        The authors write in English even though it is not their native language;
        therefore, you may notice strange sentence constructions.
        Do not hesitate to let us know, if something is not clear to you.</para>

  <para>An open source project's greatest strength is derived from getting user
        feedback. That's why we would love to hear what you have to say.
        <emphasis>Documentation contributors are always welcome!</emphasis>, 
        since this is a time consuming task.
        If you have ideas on how to improve the content,
        if you would like to write about an undocumented &krusader; feature, or
        if you have comments or suggestions about the &krusader; Handbook, please let us know.
        You can contact us even if you find typos!</para>

   <para>The Handbook "revision" matches the &krusader; version number.
         &eg; "&krusader; Handbook revision 1.80.x" describes "&krusader; 1.80.x"</para>
