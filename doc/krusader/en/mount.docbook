  <para>MountMan is a tool which helps you manage your mounted
  file systems. Once invoked, it displays a list of every mounted
  file system. For each file system, MountMan displays its name
  (which is the actual device name - &ie; 
  <filename class="directory">/dev/fd0</filename> for a 
  <hardware>floppy</hardware>), its type (vfat, ext3, ReiserFS ...)
  and its mount point on your system (the directory on which the
  file system is mounted).</para>

  <para>MountMan also displays usage information using total size,
  free size, and percentage of available space free. If those
  numbers say 
  <guilabel>N/A</guilabel>, that usually means that the file system
  is not mounted. Left clicking on a file system displays a pie chart
  on the left of the window, graphically displaying the usage
  information for the file system. Clicking on a non-mounted
  file system will display 
  <guilabel>not mounted</guilabel> instead of the graph.</para>

      <para>
      <keycap>Right-clicking</keycap> on a file system will open a
      small menu which displays what actions can be performed on
      that file system. At the moment, you can only mount, unmount
      and eject (if clicking on a removable file system, e.g., a 
      <hardware>cdrom</hardware>).</para>

  <note>
    <para>We plan to expand MountMan in the next evolution of
    &krusader;. It will be able to format floppies, edit
    <filename class="directory">/etc/fstab</filename>, create new
    file systems and more.... By the way, we have started working on
    it, see "Quickmode for MountMan"</para>

  <para>To activate Quickmode for MountMan, click and hold the

  <para>General idea: display a list of all possible mount points.
  Each time the menu is displayed, it determines if a mount point is
  mounted or not and associates the correct action (mount or
  umount). This offers a quick interface to MountMan. It is
  working, and currently uses KMountMan::mount and unmount. It uses
  the new &kde; services for fstab-reading and this will
  enable us to remove a lot of code from the "old" MountMan.</para>
