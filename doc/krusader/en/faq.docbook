        <question id="faqi_kdelibs">
          <para>Does &krusader; need &kde; to
          run?</para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>
          <emphasis>No, &krusader; does not need the
          &kde; window manager</emphasis> to run on your
          computer but &krusader;'s natural environment
          is &kde;, because it relies on services
          provided by the &kde; base libraries. Only
          some shared libraries are needed &eg;
          &kde; libraries, &Qt; libraries,
          &etc; This means that &krusader;
          runs on &gnome-url;,
          &afterstep-url;, &xfce-url; and
          other window managers provided the approriate libraries
          are installed on your computer. All this is not a problem
          since the apt-get world can resolve these dependencies
          instantly.</para>
          <para></para>
          <!-- Empty line to make it more readable -->
          <para>You do not need to switch to the &kde;
          window manager to use &krusader;; you can
          still use &gnome-url;,
          &afterstep-url;, &xfce-url; or
          another window manager. However, the configuration of the
          &krusader; fonts and some behavior is done by
          running 
          <command>kcontrol</command>.</para>
          <para></para>
          <!-- Empty line to make it more readable -->
          <para>A lot depends on what you want to do with
          &krusader;. You should know that
          &krusader; uses the &kde;
          &kioslaves1-url; to access remote file
          systems, and support for only a limited number of file
          system types are shipped with &kdelibs-url;,
          most of the &kioslaves2-url; are bundled with
          &kdebase-url; (including fish, sftp and tar).
          However, if you want the property-dialog to show
          EXIF-data for .jpeg's, you need &kde;graphics.
          If you want ID3-infos, you need
          &kde;multimedia, and so on.</para>
          <para></para>
          <!-- Empty line to make it more readable -->
          <para>To summarize, if you want a working
          &krusader; - install &kde;libs. If
          you want a functional &krusader; then you need
          &kde;libs + &kde;base. For maximum
          functionality, &krusader; needs all of the
          &kde; package libraries, but the
          &kde; window manager is optional.</para>

          <para>Which libraries does &krusader; need to

        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>For running &krusader; (&eg;
          when you have installed &krusader; with a
          binary RPM) you need less libraries than if you compile
          &krusader; from source. &eg; you
          only need the C-compliler &gcc; when you
          compile &krusader; from source (see the next
          question).</para>

          <para>Most RPM-based distributions separate the headers
          from the libs. The headers are needed to compile
          &krusader;. Look for packages in the form
          foo-devel-*.rpm (&eg; 
          <filename>kdelibs-devel-foo.i586.rpm</filename>) or
          foo-dev-*.deb for &debian; based
          distributions. These are usually included with your
          distribution.

          <para>I'm trying to install binary foo (RPM or DEB
          package), but it fails. What's wrong?</para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>Since we only prepare (and use) the source, we have
          no way of knowing this. Did you test the binary RPM
          before installing? 
          <screen><prompt>$</prompt> <userinput><command>rpm</command> <option>-i --test</option> <replaceable>&lt;/path/to/rpmfile&gt; krusader-x.xx.dist.rpm</replaceable></userinput></screen> 
          If the prompt returns without any message, then
          everything is OK. RPM's downloaded from our website are
          usually provided by &krusader; users. Visit
          your distro website and search for an updated RPM.</para>
          <para>If the RPM is not OK, try to find another package
          at &Linux; software archives such as
          &freshmeat-url; or &kde-apps-url;.
          If you still can't find the appropriate package for your
          &Linux; distribution, we recommend searching
          for it with &rpmfind-url; or
          &rpmpbone-url;.</para>
          <para>In general, a package for an older version of your
          distrubution or even for another distribution might work
          on your computer (&eg; FC RPM's often work on
          Mdk and RH, and vice versa), but it is always the best
          that you install only RPM's that exactly match your
          distribution. If you can't find a package that matches
          your distribution version, architecture or distribution,
          then use a source RPM. When you use a source RPM, the
          Krusader sources will be built, on your computer,
          guaranteeing a suitable binary RPM for your specific
          distribution and architecture. In addition, this method
          results in maximum system speed, since the resulting
          binary is customized for your computer. Please read the
          previous question, it explains how to install a source
          RPM. The best solution is explained in the next
          question.</para>

        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>Check if your distribution provides
          &krusader;, if it doesn't then contact your
          distribution creator and ask them to include
          &krusader;!</para>
          <para>Did you take a look at the &URL;'s on
          the &install-proc-lnk; page? If you have and
          found nothing, you can always compile
          &krusader; from source. Even if you feel you
          haven't got the necessary skills, you will probably
          succeed in compiling &krusader;: we provide a
          very detailed installation procedure. This HowTo enables
          newcomers to compile &krusader; from source,
          even if they have never done a compilation from source
          before, just follow the instructions carefully. Feel free

          <guimenu>"Help"</guimenu> menu appears. Why?</para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>In this case only the 
          <guimenu>Help</guimenu> menu is visible and all other menu
          items like &eg; 
          <guimenu>File</guimenu> and 
          <guimenu>Select</guimenu> are missing. This is because
          some distributions put the 
          <filename>krusaderui.rc</filename> file in the wrong
          directory. To solve the problem, just copy the 
          <filename>krusaderui.rc</filename> file from the package 
          <filename>
          krusader_kde3/krusader/krusaderui.rc</filename> to

        <answer>
          <para>The 
          <filename>krusaderui.rc</filename> file is stored in 
          <filename>
          $KDEDIR/share/apps/krusader/krusaderui.rc</filename>.
          When you change the 
          <guilabel>"Toolbar"</guilabel>, &kde; makes a
          copy of that file in the home directory at 
          <filename>
          ~/.kde/share/apps/krusader/krusaderui.rc</filename>. If
          Krusader was previously installed on your computer, and
          you install a newer &krusader; version the 
          <filename>
          ~/.kde/share/apps/krusader/krusaderui.rc</filename> file
          must be replaced with the newer version. Note: this will
          also reset all your changes on toolbars and
          shortcuts!</para>
          <para>The first line of 
          <filename>krusaderui.rc</filename> contains the version
          number. After installing a newer &krusader;
          version, &kde; will automatically replace the
          old 
          <filename>
          ~/.kde/share/apps/krusader/krusaderui.rc</filename> with
          the newer version when starting the new
          &krusader; for the first time
          (&kde; will detect the newer version number in
          the first line).</para>
          <para>If you install a CVS or beta version and

          <para>I have a 
          <filename>libGLcore.so.1</filename> compile error after
          using the &nvidia; installer, what to
          do?</para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>This problem occurs when you use the
          &nvidia; installer and not the official
          &nvidia; packages of your distribution.
          &krusader; is based on &Qt; which
          can be linked against the X OpenGL libraries. As a result
          &krusader; may look for OpenGL as well. The
          problem is that the &nvidia; installer (prior
          to version 7xxx) doesn't perform it's task properly: it
          replaces the OpenGL header files (which get included into
          &krusader;) but doesn't set the libGL links
          correctly. The best solution is to use the
          &nvidia; packages provided by your distributor
          or a new &nvidia; installer, the current
          version at the moment of writing is 7114. If, for some
          reason, you must use an old &nvidia; driver,
          one solution is the following hack, the exact commands
          depend on the distribution used and the version of the
          &nvidia; driver (6111 in this example), but it
          should read something like this:

        <question id="faqu_supermount">
          <para>When I try to mount/unmount my cdrom/floppy,
          &krusader; reports something about a
          supermount, what's this about?</para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>Supermount is a daemon which handles the
          mounting/unmounting of removable filesystems for you.
          Just insert a floppy, and do 
          <userinput>
            <command>cd</command>
            <option>
              <replaceable>/mnt/floppy</replaceable>
            </option>
          </userinput>supermount will do the mount for you
          automatically and transparently. Usually this works fine.
          However, supermount misleads the system into thinking
          that the 
          <hardware>floppy/cdrom</hardware> is mounted at all times!
          This creates some problems for &krusader;, as
          it cannot really know when the floppy or CD has been
          removed because the system information is not correctly
          updated by supermount - is there really a 
          <hardware>floppy</hardware> in the 
          <hardware>drive</hardware>? Of course, this can be
          solved, but as for now, we don't consider it a
          priority.</para>

        <question id="faqu_dead_mountpoint">
          <para>Why does &krusader; freeze or hang on a
          dead mountpoint?</para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>When &krusader; is &eg;
          browsing an NFS share and the NFS server goes down,
          &krusader; will freeze. This
          &krusader; (and all other open internal
          viewers/editors) freeze is fatal, and can only be
          corrected with the 
          <command>kill -9</command>. We have no solution for this.
          This is an issue not confined to file managers, or even
          the &Linux; OS! The problem is that you "hang"
          on the first access to the dead share - so there is no
          way around it, no check to avoid it, even 
          <command>ls</command> will freeze. Just trying to read
          something - anything - is enough to get you stuck. The
          one and only way around this architectural problem is
          using a multi-threaded design - this way if we get stuck,
          we don't hang the entire application event loop, but we
          don't think that the time is right for adding threads, we
          are not sure that *all* the &kde; systems out
          there are using &Qt;-mt (the multi threaded
          version of the &Qt; library), and the Krusader
          Krew may not be the right people to address this major
          issue in any case; so currently this is just a bug we
          have to learn to live with.</para>

          certain size. Why?</para>

          <para>See the 
          <guibutton>F1, F2</guibutton> (&etc;) buttons?
          They are not allowing &krusader; to downsize

          and you'll be able to resize
          &krusader; to your liking. Since version 1.51
          we have improved this greatly: when downsizing the
          buttons will look like 'F5 ..py'. When the button faces
          are too small to read a tooltip will give the complete
          text. The minimum width is 45 pixels for each
          button.</para>

        <answer>
          <para>The bad news is that we're not sure why, but it

          <para><link linkend="konfigurator">Konfigurator</link> is &krusader;s configuration module,
                when you have installed &krusader; than you have also Konfigurator.
                For some reason some people think it's an other &kde; application, but it is not, so
                you don't need to install the &kde; Desktop Enviroment to use Konfigurator.
                When runnig &krusader;, use

          The tabs are not saved if a "Panels Save Settings=Tabs"

          <para>This error will happen on &debian; (or

          krusader_1.51-1_i386.deb package. You will see the next
          error message if you try to open the handbook: "The
          requested help file could not be found. Check that you
          have installed the documentation." To fix it go to 
          <filename>
          /usr/share/doc/kde/HTML/en/krusader/</filename>, you will
          see the 
          <filename>foo.docbook.gz</filename> files. Now, you need
          to extract all these files with root privileges
          ("File-&gt;Unpack" with &krusader;)
          to create 
          <filename>foo.docbook</filename> files. Now the handbook

          <para>An open source project's greatest strength is

          longer see their own mistakes. It's natural. We want the

          make &krusader; the best and most useful file
          manager available anywhere.</para>

  <question id="faqg_valgrint">
  <para>How can i send good debug or crash reports?</para>
  </question>
  <answer>
  <para>Usually binary packages that are been used by your distribution do not contain debug information.
        Since we usually only develop and fix &krusader;-cvs, compile &krusader;-cvs in debugmode and install it, than check if the bug still exist.
        <screen><prompt>$</prompt> <userinput><command>./configure</command> <option>--enable-debug=full</option></userinput></screen>  

        Install <ulink url="http://valgrind.org">valgrind</ulink>, a suite of tools for debugging and profiling &Linux; programs.

        Run Valgrind/&krusader;
        <screen><prompt>$</prompt> <userinput><command>valgrind</command> <option>--tool=memcheck</option> <replaceable>{foo_path}/krusader</replaceable></userinput></screen>
        
        The valgrind tool will write to stdout, what really happens.
        If you could send these informations before the crash, it's almost sure, that we may fix or tell you what to do.

  <question id="faqg_crashhandler">
  <para>What todo if the KDEcrashhandler sends no usefull backtrace information?</para>
  </question>
  <answer>
  <para>Usually binary packages that are been used by your distribution do not contain debug information.
        Since we usually only develop and fix &krusader;-cvs, compile &krusader;-cvs in debugmode and install it, than check if the bug still exist.
        <screen><prompt>$</prompt> <userinput><command>./configure</command> <option>--enable-debug=full</option></userinput></screen> 
 
       If the KDEKrashhandler still doesn't provide usefull backtrace information, than sometimes a coredump will give better information. 
       Run Krusader, with disabled crashhandler.
       <screen><prompt>$</prompt> <userinput><command>krusader</command> <option>--nocrashhandler</option></userinput></screen>

       On a crash you will get a <filename>.core</filename> file, usually in your home directory.

       Run <ulink url="http://sourceware.org/gdb/">gdb</ulink>, the GNU Project Debugger
       
       <screen><prompt>$</prompt> <userinput><command>gdb</command> <option>-c</option> <replaceable>corefile krusader</replaceable></userinput></screen>
       
       Now type <command>bt</command> to get the backtrace and type <command>q</command> to quit gdb.

       Often the best debug results will be given when using the valgrint tool.

        <answer>
          <para>In the spirit of freedom of speech, everything that
          is &krusader; related can be discussed in our
          forum. It does not matter if you are a newcomer or an
          advanced user, everyone is welcome. An open source
          project's greatest strength is derived from getting user
          feedback. That is why we love to hear what you have to
          say. With your feedback we can make &krusader;
          better and better; otherwise, we are not aware of issues
          and ideas you may have. But please remember the
          following, so that we can maintain some order in the
          chaos.</para>
          <para>If the 
          <link linkend="index">Documentation</link>,
          &faq-lnk;, &kruforum-url; and
          &krudevel-url; (please use the search function
          ) can't help you, do not hesitate to post on our forum.
          The &krusader; Krew or the
          &krusader; community is always available to
          help you.</para>
          <para>Please use the &kruforumsearch-url;
          function of the &kruforum-url;, your issue may
          have been previously discussed (this allows us to
          minimize the double/triple/... postings). If your issue
          has already been discussed in the past there is a great
          chance that you will have an instant solution to your
          problem. If the issue is currently being discussed, you
          can join in the discussion. Some questions are asked over
          and over again, that's why we have created this
          &faq-lnk;. This allows us to spend more time
          developing &krusader;.</para>

          <para>An &ofm-url; is much faster than a one
          panel filemanager and faster than the command line. If

          how &krusader; feels</ulink>, there is only
          one way to discover: install it on your computer and use
          it for a while. If you prefer to waste time and lose
          productivity, continue to use one panel filemanagers
          which are based on &Windows; Explorer. Matej
