  <para>Here is your opportunity to &contribute-url; to
  the &krusader; project. There are things that need to
  be done, but can't be done by us. If you feel you can help, do not
  hesitate to contact us; every OpenSource can use some help.
  Please also check the &contribute-url; page on our
  website for more recent information. Thanks!</para>
  <para>
    <emphasis role="bold">Documentation</emphasis>
  </para>
  <para>Help is needed (we are looking for documentation writers)
  for keeping the &krusader; documentation up to date.
  The draft explanation of new features is done by the developers
  on the krusader-devel mailing list, but we need editors to add
  this information in the handbook. By playing with the new
  features these editors can give valuable information to the
  developers for making the new features even better!</para>
  <para>
    <emphasis role="bold">&krusader;
    Extensions</emphasis>
  </para>
  <para>Please upload your favourite extensions at
  &kde-files-url;, so that they become available for the
  &krusader; community. Maybe they will be shipped by
  default with &krusader; at the next release :-)) It
  features

  <ulink url="http://krusader.sourceforge.net/spread.php">let
  people know!</ulink> Write articles and reviews for internet or
  print publications. Encourage your friends to give
  &krusader; a try. Participate in forums to help others
  in the community.</para>
  <para>
    <emphasis role="bold">GUI Translations</emphasis>
  </para>
  <para>&krusader; is available in many languages, but
  usually several translations do need an update and translations
  to new languages are always welcome, please read the
  &i18n-page-url; . Even when there is already a
  translator for your native language, it is always helpful to have
  a second or third translator &eg; for proofreading.
  Sometimes the regular translator is not available when a
  translation update is needed (studies, holiday...). Please
  contact the translator/s for your native language; your help will
  be appreciated. Any translation (even partial translations) are
  accepted by the &krusader;-Krew at any time (feature
  freeze or not).</para>
  <para>
    <emphasis role="bold">Documentation Translations</emphasis>
  </para>
  <para>This documentation is translatable, if you are interested
  in translating this documentation please contact Frank.</para>
  <para>
    <emphasis role="bold">OpenUsability</emphasis>
  </para>
  <para>Using a program, understanding its interface and getting
  information out of it, is something that should always be clear
  in every application - no matter how advanced your understanding
  of operating systems is or how deep your computer literacy is.
  For that reason &krusader; asked to be included in the
  &openusability-url; project.</para>
  <para>This project joins the software developers and usability
  experts in an attempt to check all parts of a user interface for
  the inappropriate entries. Its main goal is making user
  interfaces and dialogs understandable and friendly to every user.
  We need our users comments, your comments, to make things better.
  In case you find a part of the program's interface to be too
  complicated, please do help us correct it and make it
  better.</para>
  <para>
    <emphasis role="bold">Donations</emphasis>
  </para>
  <para>Actually, we hadn't considered donations, until users asked
  us for a way to &donate-url; to the project.
  &krusader; is, and always will be free, in all the
  terms of the GNU Public License.</para>
  <para>
    <emphasis role="bold">Packagers</emphasis>
  </para>
  <para>We are always in need of packagers for different distro
  rpm's, deb's, etc. All help is welcome.</para>
  <para>
    <emphasis role="bold">Users' feedback for the
    &krusader; &MacOS; X port</emphasis>
  </para>
  <para>There is a &macosx-port-url; 
        with the help of &fink-url; , the port is
        maintained by 
        <ulink url="http://hritcu.wordpress.com/about/">Catalin Hritcu</ulink>, 
        all feedback is welcome.</para>
  <para>
    <emphasis role="bold">Porting &krusader; to
    &Windows;</emphasis>
  </para>
  <para>&krusader; is written using &Qt; as
  well as &kde;libs. As long as &kde;libs
  does not run on &Windows;, porting
  &krusader; is not an option. However, we do believe
  that once &Qt;4-GPL is released, efforts will be made
  to port &kde;libs to &Windows;, and if that
  happens, we're in business and then we need a maintainer for
  porting &krusader; to &Windows;.</para>
  <para>
    <emphasis role="bold">FAQ</emphasis>
  </para>
  <para>If you have a question that is missing in the
  &faq-lnk;, we would like to hear it.</para>
  <para>
    <emphasis role="bold">Others</emphasis>
  </para>
  <para>
  <link linkend="faqg_wish">Feedback</link>, 
  <link linkend="faqg_bug_report">Bug reports</link>, patches,
  &etc; are always welcome! An open source project's
  greatest strength is derived from getting user feedback.</para>
  <para>On some websites like &freshmeat-url; or
  &kde-apps-url; you can give a rate, if you like
  &krusader; go to one of these sites and rate
  &krusader;, thanks.</para>
