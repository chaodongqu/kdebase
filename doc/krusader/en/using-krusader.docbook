      <title>General</title>
      <para>This is a rather short but important section that will
      go into the details of controlling &krusader;.
      This section does not try to cover all the various key
      combinations for two reasons: 
      <orderedlist numeration="arabic">
        <listitem>
          <para>there are just too many of them</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>most of &krusader; actions are
          configurable in the
          &konfiglookandfeel-lnk;</para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>We will only mention the most important
      keyboard shortcuts with the default configuration, but keep
      in mind that most of the &keybindigs-lnk; are
      configurable. If you find that you use a certain command a
      lot and want to know the shortcut for this command, or you
      want to change this command shortcut, then check out the
      &keybindigs-lnk; tab at the
      &konfiglookandfeel-lnk;.</para>
    </sect2>
    <sect2 id="moving-around">
      <title>Moving Around</title>
      <para>By Moving Around we mean the transfer of the keyboard
      and mouse focus between the different parts of the
      &krusader; 
      <link linkend="mainwindow">main window</link>. The focus can
      be in one of five places: the Left or Right Panel, the Menu
      Bar, the Command Line or the Terminal Emulator. The panel
      that has the focus is called the Active Panel. An Active
      Panel will remain active until the other panel receives the
      focus (&ie;: if the Left Panel was active and you
      clicked on the Command Line - then the Left Panel remains the
      Active Panel). You must deliberately change which panel is
      active.</para>
      <para>The most common way to transfer the focus to a specific
      panel is to use the mouse to click on that panel. But you
      should be aware of the following: 
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Clicking on the Toolbar, the FN keys bar or the
          Status Bar does *not* change the focus.</para>

     <para>The display part of the Quick View Panel does not accept clicks so you should click on the
           Location Toolbar of this panel if you want it to have focus.</para>
   </listitem>
-->
        <listitem>
          <para>Pushing the 
          <guibutton>"History"</guibutton> or the 
          <guibutton>"Run in Terminal"</guibutton> buttons in the
          Command Line will not transfer the focus, so you have to
          click inside the Input Line.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>When you choose a menu, the Menu Bar will become
          focused. It remains focused until you choose a command -
          the focus returns to the previous owner.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist></para>
      <para>There are, of course, ways to use the keyboard to
      change the focus: 
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>The &Tab; Key will switch panels, if one
          of the panels has the focus or rotate between all the
          commands in a menu, if the Menu Bar is active.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>The 
          <keycombo action="simul">&Ctrl;
          <keycap>Down Arrow</keycap></keycombo> will take you from
          the Active Panel to the Command Line or Terminal
          Emulator, and the 
          <keycombo action="simul">&Ctrl;
          <keycap>Up Arrow</keycap></keycombo> will take you back
          from the Command Line to the Active Panel.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>The &Esc; Key will make the Menu Bar
          return the focus, if it has it, to the previous Active
          Panel.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>If you happen to be inside the Terminal Emulator,
          you can use the &Tab; Key, or the mouse, to
          navigate to an Active Panel.</para>

        <listitem>
          <para>Pressing 
          <keycombo action="simul">&Alt;

          is a "Reserved Key", used by one of
          &krusader;'s actions).</para>

      <title>Selecting</title>
      <note>
        <para>&krusader; offers 4
        &mouse-selection-modes-lnk;, only
        &krusader;'s Mouse Selection Mode is explained
        here.</para>
      </note>
      <para>Selecting is a skill you need to master in order to get
      the most out of &krusader;. Since you can not select
      files in the Quick View Panel, and the Tree Panel only lets
      you select one directory at a time, this paragraph mainly
      explains how to select files in the List Panel
      filelist.</para>
      <para>Moving the cursor is easy. Left-clicking on a file or
      directory (referred to herein as "elements" meaning files AND
      directories) will select it. Here are some useful pointers
      that will make &krusader; even easier to use (assuming you are
      using &krusader;'s Mouse Selection Mode): 
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>The 
          <keycap>SPACE</keycap> and

          the file under the cursor without affecting the selection
          of other files/directories, the cursor will go one
          position down.</para>

        <listitem>
          <para>Pressing the 
          <keycap>SPACE</keycap> on a Directory under the cursor

    <sect2 id="executing_commands">
      <title>Executing Commands</title>
      <para>There is not a lot to say here, all you need to do is
      select some files (if you do not, &krusader; will
      operate on the file(s) or directory(s) that have the focus),
      choose a 
      <link linkend="menu-commands">Command</link> from the Menu Bar
      or use a Keyboard Shortcut (or the Right Click Menu) and the
      selected Command executes. See also

      <title>Quicksearch</title>
      <!-- Thanks to Heiner Eichmann -->
      <para>This feature will do a quick search for the file name
      in the Active List Panel.</para>
      <para>Type 
      <keycap>foo</keycap>(one character) to do a quick search in
      the Active List Panel for a file beginning with "foo". A
      small quick search dialog box will open below the Active List
      Panel. Type the first few characters of the desired file name
      (more than one character allowed), the cursor will jump to
      that filename (if it exists), &eg; type "ab" to
      search for a file which begins with "ab". The 
      <keycap>Up/Down Arrow</keycap>will jump to the next or
      previous match. &Esc; will close the quick search
      line. The cursor will stay on the last file
      found.</para>
      <note>
        <para>If you press 
        <keycombo action="simul">&Alt;
        <keycap>foo</keycap></keycombo>, the key binding shortcut
        will be executed. If there is no configured key binding,
        the remaining letter 
        <keycap>foo</keycap>will be used for the quick
        search.</para>

    <sect2 id="context-menu">
      <title>Context Menu</title>
      <para>&krusader; has many Context menus that allow
      you to do fast operations with the mouse, usually a
      right-click will open the Context menu (depending on your
      &mouse-selection-modes-lnk; settings). This list
      gives an overview of the most important context menus. Use
      them to discover the available commands.

      <para>You can only execute files in the Active List Panel. To
      <keycap>execute</keycap> a file just 
      <keycap>(double-)click on it or press Enter</keycap> when it
      is under the list cursor. &krusader; will open it
      in the default application for this file type (picture,

      binary...). If you want to use 
      <keycap>another application</keycap> to open the file, 
      <keycap>Right-Click</keycap> on the file and go to the "open

      &krusader; is compatible with &kde;
      default file manager for all file types except archives that
      are opened inside the &krusader; panel and not in
